                <span>A Mini Bio</span>
            </h1>

            <p>
	          Born in Cambodia, my family moved to Auckland, New Zealand when I was eight. [2012] I graduated university with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. [2014] I moved to Invercargill to live with my partner and worked both as a lecturer and teaching assistant in the Information Technology Department at the Southern Institute of Technology. [2016] Afterward we had new opportunities in Christchurch so moved there where I worked as a full time software developer. [2018] My boyfriend and I embarked on a cycling tour from China to Europe. [2019] Arrived in London after passing through Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe's Mediterranean Coast. After a total of 22 months on the road, I’m settling down in London for new career opportunities in IT.</p>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>
            I have an academic background in Computer Science and some languages (Mandarin, German and Khmer). Try my best to bring a positive attitude to work, team building and taking initiatives to make the workplace enjoyable and fun. During my recent cycle trip, I demonstrated skills such as project management, planning, attention to detail and various behavioural skills like perseverance, resilience, and adaptability. It was a real life challenge to follow this goal and it was achieved through meticulous planning, being highly adaptable to changes, demonstrating perseverance through thick and thin. It's difficult to challenge oneself as much as I have challenged myself over the last 22 months.
            </p>

	          <h3>Interests</h3>
	          <p>
	          My interests include travelling, learning foreign languages, cycling, hiking and tramping. Cooking and baking at home is one of my favourite pastimes. My technical interests include app/mobile development, UX research and interface design.

                Now I'm in London, working at IG Index and web developing for a product of theirs that enables trading online 24/7. With plenty of travel material, I put together a travel blog based on Angular and hosted on Github Pages. <a href="https://aleang.github.io/pedco" target="_blank">Pedco</a> is short for Pedalling Continent (my unofficial travel brand). Then in March, the UK went into lockdown and we all got housebound. I made a series of Instagram Pop Quizzes out of boredom and it became quite popular. The quiz was only interactive for 24 hours so I created the <a href="https://aleang.github.io/pedco-quiz/" target="_blank">Pedalling Continents Blog Quiz</a> SPA that allows anyone anytime to give the quiz a try. At work, I created a Microsoft PowerApp that aimed to support teamwork and foster kudos sharing. The application connected easily within the company's existing messaging application (MS Teams). My team has been using it for the last 4 months and it has been coming along very well.

                During the travel I blogged with WordPress and SteemIt. SteemIt was a decentralised social media platform which rewards the author with Steem Token (a cryptocurrency). The travel community use a platform called <a href="https://github.com/travelfeed-io/travelfeed-io" target="_blank">TravelFeed</a> which is an open-source project I am very interested in contributing to. I'm looking forward to contributing to the development of this project. If you interested in the actual travel blog, it is called <a href="https://pedallingcontinents.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Pedalling Continent</a>. Photos on our Instagram can be found at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pedallingcontinents" target="_blank">@pedallingcontinent</a>.

            </h1>
            <p>
                 When I was working as the teaching assistant in the IT department in Invercargill, NZ, I saw the opportunity to automate the process of producing multi-choice exam papers. There wasn't many available solution available to suited my need so I created one that was simple to use and easy to format. The final solution was a Java based application which took in a textfile for input, and outputted HTML files (Questions and Answers) which can be easily printed. If you are sick of randomising test questions and want it done automatically with only a few clicks, give <a href="https://github.com/aleang/examgenerator">Exam Generator</a> a try!

            </h1>
            <p>
                During my university study, I studied Mandarin and German along with my Computer Science degree. [2012-14] The opportunity to create something together sprang to mind and I created a website using JavaScript, jQuery and various shared libraries. This personal project allowed me to experiment with the design and user flow. There are various user interface control to improve the user experience such as keyboard shortcuts, visual aids (animation on buttons, tooltips), and multimedia controls (sound and video). Select a popular Mandarin song and <a href="Karaoke/index.html">start singing!</a>

                After completing my first assignment developing a game using basic GUI components freshly taught in class, I really enjoyed creating applications from all sorts of inspiration and ideas. Each one were documented and added to my previous portfolio which was hosted on Google Sites. Check out this extensive list to see some examples of my (fairly beginner material) <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myjavaportfolio/system/app/pages/subPages?path=/java-c-sharp-apps/fun-misc" target="_blank">Java works</a>. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNflYbdjm-1HuHBRvLPLL0u4VKSp5zOY-" target="_blank">YouTube</a> videos for some of the applications. Some examples of my work...
