                At home you'll find me cooking and baking, if my current home has a backyard, I'll be getting my green fingers dirty.

            <p>
                When I'm away from home, it'll be travelling somewhere so I can practice foreign languages, tour cycling between towns, or hiking some hills.

                After completing my 2 years trip, I had plenty of travel materials so put together a travel blog made with Angular and hosted it on Github Pages. "Pedco" is short for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pedallingcontinents/" target="_blank">@pedallingcontinent</a> (our "unofficial" travel brand).

                Then in March 2020, the UK went into lockdown and we all got housebound. I made a series of Instagram Pop Quizzes out of boredom and it became quite popular. The quiz was only interactive for 24 hours so I created the <a href="https://aleang.github.io/pedco-quiz/" target="_blank">Pedalling Continents Blog Quiz</a> SPA that allows anyone anytime to give the quiz a try.

                At work, I created a Microsoft PowerApp that aimed to support teamwork and foster kudos sharing. The application connected easily within the company's existing messaging application (Microsoft Teams). My team has been using it for the last 4 months and it has been coming along very well.

            </h1>
            <p>
                 When I was working as the teaching assistant in the IT department in Invercargill, NZ, I saw the opportunity to automate the process of producing multi-choice exam papers. There wasn't many available solution available to suited my need so I created one that was simple to use and easy to format. The final solution was a Java based application which took in a textfile for input, and outputted HTML files (Questions and Answers) which can be easily printed. If you are sick of randomising test questions and want it done automatically with only a few clicks, give <a href="https://github.com/aleang/examgenerator">Exam Generator</a> a try!

            <p>
                During my university study, I studied Mandarin and German along with my Computer Science degree. [2012-14] The opportunity to create something together sprang to mind and I created a website using JavaScript, jQuery and various shared libraries. This personal project allowed me to experiment with the design and user flow. There are various user interface control to improve the user experience such as keyboard shortcuts, visual aids (animation on buttons, tooltips), and multimedia controls (sound and video). Select a popular Mandarin song and <a href="Karaoke/index.html">start singing!</a>

            <p>
                After completing my first assignment developing a game using basic GUI components freshly taught in class, I really enjoyed creating applications from all sorts of inspiration and ideas. Each one were documented and added to my previous portfolio which was hosted on Google Sites. Check out this extensive list to see some examples of my (fairly beginner material) <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myjavaportfolio/system/app/pages/subPages?path=/java-c-sharp-apps/fun-misc" target="_blank">Java works</a>. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNflYbdjm-1HuHBRvLPLL0u4VKSp5zOY-" target="_blank">YouTube</a> videos for some of the applications. Some examples of my work...
