            <h3>Interests</h3>
	        <p>
                At home you'll find me cooking and baking, if my current home has a backyard, I'll be getting my green fingers dirty.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm away from home, it'll be travelling somewhere so I can practice foreign languages, tour cycling between towns, or hiking some hills.

            <h3>Pedco, the blog</h3>
            <p>
                After completing my 2 years trip, my partner and I had accumulated plenty of travel materials, tons of cycling metrics and stories. Naturally, I made a <strong>travel blog</strong> with Angular and hosted it on Github Pages. "Pedco" is short for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pedallingcontinents/" target="_blank">@pedallingcontinent</a> (our "unofficial" Instagram travel brand).
            </p>

            <h3>Pedalling Continents Blog Quiz</h3>
            <p>
                Once the travel stopped and the world went into lockdown, it became difficult to create content for our social media followers. Using random photos from the travel that weren't good enough to be featured, I upcycled them into a series of pop quizzes using Instagram's Story platform. It got quite popular. The quiz was active for 24 hours and I shared the answers the next day, every weekend until the lockdown ended. A total of seven sets were made for different portions of the trip. Why not test yourself?

            <h3>London, UK (2020)</h3>
            <p>
                The pandemic forced everyone to work from home where possible. This meant that social interaction between my colleagues at IG was significantly reduced. I never thought I could work from home. Was there any choice in this unprecedented time?
            </p>
            <p>
                To foster a supportive and praising working environment, I created an app within the Microsoft Teams messaging app called <strong>Kudos</strong>. The Power App connected with ease to the workplace's existing chatting channels and team information infrastructure. When someone wants to acknowledge and thank another member, they can raise a kudos on the app, which then gets shared to the entire team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional features I have added to increase awesomeness, business/management appeal and competitiveness:
                <ol>
                    <li>Personalised recorded gif of ourselves clapping in the shared team channel,</li>
                    <li>Each recorded kudos can be associated with some of the company's core values,</li>
                    <li>"Team Kudos" is a leaderboard showing the tally of kudos and <a href="https://www.iggroup.com/about-us/who-we-are/our-purpose-and-values" title="At IG the core values were 'Love What We Do', 'Champion the Client', 'Lead the Way'.">IG's core values</a> that each member has received,</li>
                    <li>In our fortnightly <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective" title="Retrospective">retro</a> we dedicate time to look back at the kudos raised, and every alternate retro, the member at the top of the leaderboard wins a Managers Recognition award.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Invercargill, NZ (2015)</h3>
            <p>
                When I was the teaching assistant at the IT department of the Southern Institute of Technology, I saw the opportunity to automate the process of producing multi-choice exam papers. There weren't many options available that suited my need, so instead, I created one that was easy to use and format. The final product was a Java-based application which took in a text file for input and outputted HTML files (the Questions and Answers) which can then be printed. If you are sick of randomising test questions and want it done automatically with only a few clicks, give <a href="https://github.com/aleang/examgenerator" target="_blank">Exam Generator</a> a try!

            <p>
                During my university study, I studied Mandarin and German on the side with my Computer Science degree. I wanted to create something that will put all my newly acquired skills together. I made a website using JavaScript, jQuery and various other shared libraries. This personal project challenged my design skills which I had always wanted to work on. The end result included plenty of UI controls that improved the user's experience. Keyboard shortcuts, visual aids (animation on buttons, tooltips), and multimedia controls (sound and video). Select a popular Mandarin song and <a href="Karaoke/index.html" target="_blank">start singing!</a>

                After completing my first assignment developing a game using basic GUI components freshly taught in class, I really enjoyed creating applications from all sorts of inspiration and ideas. Each one were documented and added to my previous portfolio which was hosted on Google Sites. Check out this extensive list to see some examples of my (fairly beginner material) <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myjavaportfolio/system/app/pages/subPages?path=/java-c-sharp-apps/fun-misc" target="_blank">Java works</a>. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNflYbdjm-1HuHBRvLPLL0u4VKSp5zOY-" target="_blank">YouTube</a> videos for some of the applications. Some examples of my work...
