                I have been without a computer for 2 years! The only piece of technology I had with me was a Google Pixel smartphone and a very old Samsung tablet. While in London, I'll be picking up some new skills after getting a new laptop.

                During the travel we blogged using WordPress and SteemIt. On SteemIt there is a community of travel bloggers using <a href="https://github.com/travelfeed-io/travelfeed-io" target="_blank">TravelFeed.io</a> which is an open-source project which I am very interested in working in. I'm looking forward to contributing to the development of this project. If you interested in the actual travel blog, the blog is called <a href="https://pedallingcontinents.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Pedalling Continent</a>. Photos on our Instagram can be found under the tag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pedallingcontinents" target="_blank">@pedallingcontinent</a>.

            </h1>
            <p>
                During my university study, I studied Mandarin and German along with my Computer Science degree. [2012-14] The opportunity to create something together sprang to mind and I created a website using JavaScript, jQuery and various shared libraries. This personal project allowed me to experiment with the design and user flow. There are various user interface control to improve the user experience such as keyboard shortcuts, visual aids (animation on buttons, tooltips), and multimedia controls (sound and video). Select a popular Mandarin song and <a href="Karaoke/index.html">start singing!</a>
