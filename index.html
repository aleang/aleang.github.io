[2016] Afterward we had new opportunities in Christchurch so moved there to work as a full time software developer. [2019] Arrived in London after a long distance bicycle tour from China to Portugal. After 21 months on the road, I’m settling in London for new career opportunities in IT. </p>

                I have been without a computer for two years! The only piece of technology I had with me was a Google Pixel smartphone and (now) a very old Samsung tablet. While in London, I'll be picking back up some skills after getting a new laptop and let the fingers get busy again on the keyboard.

                During the travel I blogged with WordPress and SteemIt. SteemIt was a decentralised social media platform which rewards the author with Steem Token (a cryptocurrency). The travel community use a platform called <a href="https://github.com/travelfeed-io/travelfeed-io" target="_blank">TravelFeed</a> which is an open-source project I am very interested in contributing to. I'm looking forward to contributing to the development of this project. If you interested in the actual travel blog, it is called <a href="https://pedallingcontinents.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Pedalling Continent</a>. Photos on our Instagram can be found at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pedallingcontinents" target="_blank">@pedallingcontinent</a>.

            </h1>
            <p>
                 When I was working as the teaching assistant in the IT department in Invercargill, NZ, I saw the opportunity to automate the process of producing multi-choice exam papers. There wasn't many available solution available to suited my need so I created one that was simple to use and easy to format. The final solution was a Java based application which took in a textfile for input, and outputted HTML files (Questions and Answers) which can be easily printed. If you are sick of randomising test questions and want it done automatically with only a few clicks, give <a href="https://github.com/aleang/examgenerator">Exam Generator</a> a try! <img src="ExamGenerator/examgenerator-v6.jpg"/>

            <p>
                During my university study, I studied Mandarin and German along with my Computer Science degree. [2012-14] The opportunity to create something together sprang to mind and I created a website using JavaScript, jQuery and various shared libraries. This personal project allowed me to experiment with the design and user flow. There are various user interface control to improve the user experience such as keyboard shortcuts, visual aids (animation on buttons, tooltips), and multimedia controls (sound and video). Select a popular Mandarin song and <a href="Karaoke/index.html">start singing!</a><img src="https://sites.google.com/site/myjavaportfolio/_/rsrc/1472778405084/html-projects/karaoke/site_features.jpg"/>

            <p>
                After completing my first assignment developing a game using basic GUI components freshly taught in class, I really enjoyed creating applications from all sorts of inspiration and ideas. Each one were documented and added to my previous portfolio which was hosted on Google Sites. Check out this extensive list to see some examples of my (fairly beginner material) <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/myjavaportfolio/system/app/pages/subPages?path=/java-c-sharp-apps/fun-misc" target="_blank">Java works</a>. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNflYbdjm-1HuHBRvLPLL0u4VKSp5zOY-" target="_blank">YouTube</a> videos for some of the applications. Some examples of my work...
